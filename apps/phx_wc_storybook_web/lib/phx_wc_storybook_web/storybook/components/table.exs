              Former moisture farmer and Jedi Knight whose coming of age and rise as a Jedi are portrayed in the original Star Wars trilogy. He is the son of Anakin Skywalker and Padm√© Amidala, Leia Organa's twin brother, and Ben Solo's uncle.[18] After his birth, he was adopted by the Lars family on Tatooine to keep him safe and hidden from the Galactic Empire. After the Empire's defeat, Luke becomes a Jedi Master and attempts to rebuild the Jedi Order, starting with briefly training Grogu,[19] but goes into self-exile on the planet Ahch-To after Ben falls to the dark side, becomes Kylo Ren, and takes part in the murder of his other students. He later reluctantly trains Rey, and dies helping the Resistance escape from the First Order. His Force spirit eventually helps Rey defeat a resurrected Palpatine to end the Sith once and for all, and later gives her his blessing to adopt the Skywalker surname and continue his family's legacy.
